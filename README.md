# NovaCrypt Cryptographic Library

## Overview

NovaCrypt provides advanced cryptographic operations using:
- Topological data transformations
- Neural entropy processing
- Multi-layered encryption
- Built-in tamper detection
- Context-aware key mutation

## Security Features

1. **Topological Data Transformation**
   - Projects data onto a high-dimensional manifold
   - Applies nonlinear transformations in manifold space
   - Creates complex interdependencies between data points

2. **Neural Entropy Processing**
   - Processes data through dynamic transformations
   - Adapts to system state and environmental factors
   - Provides resistance to pattern analysis

3. **Multi-Layered Encryption**
   - Applies encryption in multiple passes
   - Each layer uses different transformation parameters
   - Provides defense in depth against attacks

4. **Built-in Validation**
   - Generates integrity verification tags
   - Detects any ciphertext modification
   - Prevents tampering and brute-force attempts

5. **Key Mutation**
   - Keys adapt based on runtime context
   - Incorporates system entropy sources
   - Provides unique encryption results even with identical inputs
